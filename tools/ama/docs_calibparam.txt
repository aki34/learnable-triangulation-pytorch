Short description of the essential output parameters
----------------------------------------------------

- camera%d.Pmat.cal ... contains the 3x4 euclidean projection matrix
  which encodes all linear parameters. You can use function
  ./MultiCamValidation/CoreFunctions/P2KRtC.m to decompose it into the
  intrinsic parameteres in 3x3 K matrix, rotation matrix R and
  translation vector t, as well as the position of the camera center C
  in the common world coordinate system.

- basename%d.rad ... contains the paremeters needed for undoing radial
  distortion. They should be directly applicable in the openCV
  implementation of the undoing non-linear distortion.

- *.eps figures. I hope the names are rather self-explaining.

------------------------------------------------------

You can edit the function
./MultiCamSelfCal/OutputFunctions/savecalpar.m according to your
needs.
